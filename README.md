# GDP-Planet

This app is an interactive way of visualizing economics data. Select two countries you wish to compare, indicate the metric (GDP, HDI, GINI, etc.) and the two countries will appear as planets in the universe.
The mass and size of the planets are proportional to the value of their metric. Hence, planets will revolve around each other based on their relative metric values.
The spin of the planet is poportional to the yearly change in that metric.
